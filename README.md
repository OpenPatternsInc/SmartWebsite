# SmartWebsite
Main Website for OpenPatterns

Made with html 5, css and javascript.

The whole page loads at once, so getting to the second page can not be hindered by your internet connection. Therefore, all sections always take the same amount of time to be visible.

No one can see which pages you visited, therefore maintaining your privacy.

Specific pages can be linked to by using the "#" symbol. For instance openpatterns.net/#ents.
